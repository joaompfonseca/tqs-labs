# TQS Homework 1 - Environment Monitor

## Description

This Spring Boot based application provides information about the quality of the air for a specified location. It displays the current and forecast air quality index and metrics on a table, and provides a graph to visualize the fluctuation of the forecast metrics. It also provides statistics over the use of the internal cache, used to store recent made requests to the external APIs provided by OpenWeather and OpenMeteo.

The main purpose of this application is to demonstrate the application of many software testing strategies such as unit tests and integration tests in JUnit 5, functional tests with Selenium and static code analysis on Sonar Cloud. A GitHub Actions workflow was put in place to automate not only these processes, but to also deploy the solution in a Microsoft Azure Web App, implementing a full CI/CD pipeline.
